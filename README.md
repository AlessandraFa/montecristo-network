# Graphing Revenge: A Network Analysis of 'The Count of Monte Cristo'

The project "Graphing Revenge: A Network Analysis of 'The Count of Monte Cristo'" was developed for the Exam "Web Science" for the DHDK master at the University of Bologna. It conducts a network analysis of Alexandre Dumas' novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo', focusing on character interactions. The study defines character interactions and constructs a network to uncover insights into core themes such as revenge and redemption.
