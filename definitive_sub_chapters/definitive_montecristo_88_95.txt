 Chapter 88. The Insult

At the banker’s door Beauchamp stopped AlbertdeMorcerf.

“Listen,” said he; “just now I told you it was of M. de EdmondDantes you must demand an explanation.”

“Yes; and we are going to his house.”

“Reflect, AlbertdeMorcerf, one moment before you go.”

“On what shall I reflect?”

“On the importance of the step you are taking.”

“Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars?”

“Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know, think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel. The other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do you not fear to find him a bully?”

“I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.”

“Do not be alarmed,” said Beauchamp; “he will meet you. My only fear is that he will be too strong for you.”

“My friend,” said AlbertdeMorcerf, with a sweet smile, “that is what I wish. The happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my father’s stead; that would save us all.”

“Your mother would die of grief.”

“My poor mother!” said AlbertdeMorcerf, passing his hand across his eyes, “I know she would; but better so than die of shame.”

“Are you quite decided, AlbertdeMorcerf?”

“Yes; let us go.”

“But do you think we shall find the count at home?”

“He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at home.”

They ordered the driver to take them to No. 30 Champs-Élysées. Beauchamp wished to go in alone, but AlbertdeMorcerf observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels. The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes; he yielded and contented himself with following AlbertdeMorcerf. AlbertdeMorcerf sprang from the porter’s lodge to the steps. He was received by Baptistin. The count had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted.

“But after his bath?” asked AlbertdeMorcerf.

“My master will go to dinner.”

“And after dinner?”

“He will sleep an hour.”

“Then?”

“He is going to the Opera.”

“Are you sure of it?” asked AlbertdeMorcerf.

“Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o’clock precisely.”

“Very good,” replied AlbertdeMorcerf; “that is all I wished to know.”

Then, turning towards Beauchamp, “If you have anything to attend to, Beauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening, defer it till tomorrow. I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera; and if you can, bring ChateauRenaud with you.”

Beauchamp availed himself of AlbertdeMorcerf’s permission, and left him, promising to call for him at a quarter before eight. On his return home, AlbertdeMorcerf expressed his wish to FranzdEpinay LucienDebray, and MaximilianMorrel, to see them at the Opera that evening. Then he went to see his mother, who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone, and had kept her room. He found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation.

The sight of AlbertdeMorcerf produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercedes; she pressed her son’s hand and sobbed aloud, but her tears relieved her. AlbertdeMorcerf stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother’s bed. It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker.

“My dear mother,” said he, “do you know if Fernand has any enemy?”

Mercedes started; she noticed that the young man did not say “my father.”

“My son,” she said, “persons in the count’s situation have many secret enemies. Those who are known are not the most dangerous.”

“I know it, and appeal to your penetration. You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.”

“Why do you say so?”

“Because, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave, that M. de EdmondDantes would eat nothing in our house.”

Mercedes raised herself on her feverish arm.

“M. de EdmondDantes!” she exclaimed; “and how is he connected with the question you asked me?”

 

“You know, mother, M. de EdmondDantes is almost an Oriental, and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.”

“Do you say M. de EdmondDantes is our enemy?” replied Mercedes, becoming paler than the sheet which covered her. “Who told you so? Why, you are mad, AlbertdeMorcerf! M. de EdmondDantes has only shown us kindness. M. de EdmondDantes saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my counsel to you—nay, my prayer—is to retain his friendship.”

“Mother,” replied the young man, “you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man.”

“I?” said Mercedes, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and again becoming paler than ever.

“Yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?”

Mercedes shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, “You speak strangely,” said she to AlbertdeMorcerf, “and you appear to have some singular prejudices. What has the count done? Three days since you were with him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend.”

An ironical smile passed over AlbertdeMorcerf’s lips. Mercedes saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was prudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears. AlbertdeMorcerf was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed:

“You came to inquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well. You should install yourself here, and cheer my solitude. I do not wish to be left alone.”

“Mother,” said the young man, “you know how gladly I would obey your wish, but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening.”

“Well,” replied Mercedes, sighing, “go, AlbertdeMorcerf; I will not make you a slave to your filial piety.”

AlbertdeMorcerf pretended he did not hear, bowed to his mother, and quitted her. Scarcely had he shut her door, when Mercedes called a confidential servant, and ordered him to follow AlbertdeMorcerf wherever he should go that evening, and to come and tell her immediately what he observed. Then she rang for her lady’s maid, and, weak as she was, she dressed, in order to be ready for whatever might happen. The footman’s mission was an easy one. AlbertdeMorcerf went to his room, and dressed with unusual care. At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived; he had seen ChateauRenaud, who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised. Both got into AlbertdeMorcerf’s _coupé_; and, as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going, he called aloud, “To the Opera.” In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance.

 

ChateauRenaud was at his post; apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances, he required no explanation from AlbertdeMorcerf. The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChateauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion. LucienDebray was not yet come, but AlbertdeMorcerf knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera.

AlbertdeMorcerf wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up. He hoped to meet with M. de EdmondDantes either in the lobby or on the stairs. The bell summoned him to his seat, and he entered the orchestra with ChateauRenaud and Beauchamp. But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns, which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act. At last, as AlbertdeMorcerf was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time, at the beginning of the second act the door opened, and EdmondDantes entered, dressed in black, and, leaning over the front of the box, looked around the pit. MaximilianMorrel followed him, and looked also for his sister and brother in-law; he soon discovered them in another box, and kissed his hand to them.

The count, in his survey of the pit, encountered a pale face and threatening eyes, which evidently sought to gain his attention. He recognized AlbertdeMorcerf, but thought it better not to notice him, as he looked so angry and discomposed. Without communicating his thoughts to his companion, he sat down, drew out his opera-glass, and looked another way. Although apparently not noticing AlbertdeMorcerf, he did not, however, lose sight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act, he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends. Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him. He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with MaximilianMorrel, but he was well prepared for what might happen.

The door opened, and EdmondDantes, turning round, saw AlbertdeMorcerf, pale and trembling, followed by Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud.

“Well,” cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world, “my cavalier has attained his object. Good-evening, Fernand.”

The countenance of this man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings, expressed the most perfect cordiality. MaximilianMorrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount, in which, without assigning any reason, he begged him to go to the Opera, but he understood that something terrible was brooding.

“We are not come here, sir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness, or false professions of friendship,” said AlbertdeMorcerf, “but to demand an explanation.”

The young man’s trembling voice was scarcely audible.

“An explanation at the Opera?” said the count, with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good. “Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians, I should not have thought this the place for such a demand.”

“Still, if people will shut themselves up,” said AlbertdeMorcerf, “and cannot be seen because they are bathing, dining, or asleep, we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen.”

“I am not difficult of access, sir; for yesterday, if my memory does not deceive me, you were at my house.”

“Yesterday I was at your house, sir,” said the young man; “because then I knew not who you were.”

In pronouncing these words AlbertdeMorcerf had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby. Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation.

“Where are you come from, sir? “ said EdmondDantes “You do not appear to be in the possession of your senses.”

“Provided I understand your perfidy, sir, and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged, I shall be reasonable enough,” said AlbertdeMorcerf furiously.

“I do not understand you, sir,” replied EdmondDantes; “and if I did, your tone is too high. I am at home here, and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another’s. Leave the box, sir!”

EdmondDantes pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity.

“Ah, I shall know how to make you leave your home!” replied AlbertdeMorcerf, clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove, which EdmondDantes did not lose sight of.

“Well, well,” said EdmondDantes quietly, “I see you wish to quarrel with me; but I would give you one piece of advice, which you will do well to keep in mind. It is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge. Display is not becoming to everyone, Fernand.”

At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene. They had talked of no one but AlbertdeMorcerf the whole day. AlbertdeMorcerf understood the allusion in a moment, and was about to throw his glove at the count, when MaximilianMorrel seized his hand, while Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud, fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge, held him back. But EdmondDantes, without rising, and leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking the damp, crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man:

“Sir,” said he in a solemn tone, “I consider your glove thrown, and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet. Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the door.”

Wild, almost unconscious, and with eyes inflamed, AlbertdeMorcerf stepped back, and MaximilianMorrel closed the door. EdmondDantes took up his glass again as if nothing had happened; his face was like marble, and his heart was like bronze. MaximilianMorrel whispered, “What have you done to him?”

“I? Nothing—at least personally,” said EdmondDantes.

“But there must be some cause for this strange scene.”

“The Count of AlbertdeMorcerf’s adventure exasperates the young man.”

“Have you anything to do with it?”

“It was through Haydee that the Chamber was informed of his father’s treason.”

“Indeed?” said MaximilianMorrel. “I had been told, but would not credit it, that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of AliPasha.”

“It is true, nevertheless.”

“Then,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I understand it all, and this scene was premeditated.”

“How so?”

“Yes. AlbertdeMorcerf wrote to request me to come to the Opera, doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you.”

“Probably,” said EdmondDantes with his imperturbable tranquillity.

“But what shall you do with him?”

“With whom?”

“With AlbertdeMorcerf.”

“What shall I do with AlbertdeMorcerf? As certainly, MaximilianMorrel, as I now press your hand, I shall kill him before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.” MaximilianMorrel, in his turn, took EdmondDantes’s hand in both of his, and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.

“Ah, count,” said he, “his father loves him so much!”

“Do not speak to me of that,” said EdmondDantes, with the first movement of anger he had betrayed; “I will make him suffer.”

MaximilianMorrel, amazed, let fall EdmondDantes’s hand. “Count, count!” said he.

“Dear MaximilianMorrel,” interrupted the count, “listen how adorably Duprez is singing that line,—

‘O Mathilde! idole de mon âme!’


“I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to applaud him. Bravo, bravo!”

MaximilianMorrel saw it was useless to say more, and refrained. The curtain, which had risen at the close of the scene with AlbertdeMorcerf, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door.

“Come in,” said EdmondDantes with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion; and immediately Beauchamp appeared. “Good-evening, M. Beauchamp,” said EdmondDantes, as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening; “be seated.”

Beauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, “Sir,” said he, “I just now accompanied Fernand, as you saw.”

“And that means,” replied EdmondDantes, laughing, “that you had, probably, just dined together. I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that you are more sober than he was.”

“Sir,” said M. Beauchamp, “AlbertdeMorcerf was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray so much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him. And having done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yanina. Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl.”

EdmondDantes motioned him to be silent. “Come,” said he, laughing, “there are all my hopes about to be destroyed.”

“How so?” asked Beauchamp.

“Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character. I am, in your opinion, a Lara, a Manfred, a Lord Ruthven; then, just as I am arriving at the climax, you defeat your own end, and seek to make an ordinary man of me. You bring me down to your own level, and demand explanations! Indeed, M. Beauchamp, it is quite laughable.”

“Yet,” replied Beauchamp haughtily, “there are occasions when probity commands——”

“M. Beauchamp,” interposed this strange man, “the EdmondDantes bows to none but the EdmondDantes himself. Say no more, I entreat you. I do what I please, M. Beauchamp, and it is always well done.”

“Sir,” replied the young man, “honest men are not to be paid with such coin. I require honorable guaranties.”

“I am, sir, a living guaranty,” replied EdmondDantes, motionless, but with a threatening look; “we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed—that is our mutual guaranty. Tell the viscount so, and that tomorrow, before ten o’clock, I shall see what color his is.”

“Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel,” said Beauchamp.

“It is quite immaterial to me,” said EdmondDantes, “and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle. In France people fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the carbine, in Arabia with the dagger. Tell your client that, although I am the insulted party, in order to carry out my eccentricity, I leave him the choice of arms, and will accept without discussion, without dispute, anything, even combat by drawing lots, which is always stupid, but with me different from other people, as I am sure to gain.”

“Sure to gain!” repeated Beauchamp, looking with amazement at the count.

“Certainly,” said EdmondDantes, slightly shrugging his shoulders; “otherwise I would not fight with Fernand. I shall kill him—I cannot help it. Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting.”

“Pistols, then, at eight o’clock, in the Bois de Vincennes,” said Beauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.

“Very well, sir,” said EdmondDantes. “Now all that is settled, do let me see the performance, and tell your friend AlbertdeMorcerf not to come any more this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms: let him go home and go to sleep.”

Beauchamp left the box, perfectly amazed.

“Now,” said EdmondDantes, turning towards MaximilianMorrel, “I may depend upon you, may I not?”

“Certainly,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I am at your service, count; still——”

“What?”

“It is desirable I should know the real cause.”

“That is to say, you would rather not?”

“No.”

“The young man himself is acting blindfolded, and knows not the true cause, which is known only to God and to me; but I give you my word, MaximilianMorrel, that God, who does know it, will be on our side.”

“Enough,” said MaximilianMorrel; “who is your second witness?”

“I know no one in Paris, MaximilianMorrel, on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother EmmanuelHerbault. Do you think EmmanuelHerbault would oblige me?”

“I will answer for him, count.”

“Well? that is all I require. Tomorrow morning, at seven o’clock, you will be with me, will you not?”

“We will.”

“Hush, the curtain is rising. Listen! I never lose a note of this opera if I can avoid it; the music of _William Tell_ is so sweet.” 


EdmondDantes waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had sung his famous “_Suivez-moi!_” then he rose and went out. MaximilianMorrel took leave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o’clock, and to bring EmmanuelHerbault. Then he stepped into his _coupé_, calm and smiling, and was at home in five minutes. No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he said:

“Ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.”

Ali brought the box to his master, who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot. These were pistols of an especial pattern, which EdmondDantes had had made for target practice in his own room. A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say, keeping his hand in.

He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target, when his study door opened, and Baptistin entered. Before he had spoken a word, the count saw in the next room a veiled woman, who had followed closely after Baptistin, and now, seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table, rushed in. Baptistin looked at his master, who made a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him.

“Who are you, madame?” said the count to the veiled woman.

 

The stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were quite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her hands, she said with an accent of despair:

“EdmondDantes, you will not kill my son!”

The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let fall the pistol he held.

“What name did you pronounce then, Mercedes?” said he.

“Yours!” cried she, throwing back her veil,—“yours, which I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten. EdmondDantes, it is not Mercedes who is come to you, it is Mercedes.”

“Mercedes is dead, madame,” said EdmondDantes; “I know no one now of that name.”

“Mercedes lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized you when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice, EdmondDantes,—by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she has followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes Fernand.”

“Fernand, do you mean?” replied EdmondDantes, with bitter irony; “since we are recalling names, let us remember them all.” EdmondDantes had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercedes felt a thrill of horror run through every vein.

“You see, EdmondDantes, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, ‘Spare my son!’”

“And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against your son?”

“No one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight. I guessed all; I followed him this evening to the Opera, and, concealed in a parquet box, have seen all.”

“If you have seen all, madame, you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me,” said EdmondDantes with awful calmness.

“Oh, for pity’s sake!”

“You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if MaximilianMorrel, one of my friends, had not stopped him.”

“Listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,—he attributes his father’s misfortunes to you.”

“Madame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,—it is a punishment. It is not I who strike Fernand; it is Providence which punishes him.”

“And why do you represent Providence?” cried Mercedes. “Why do you remember when it forgets? What are Yanina and its vizier to you, EdmondDantes? What injury has Fernand done you in betraying Ali Tepelini?”

“Ah, madame,” replied EdmondDantes, “all this is an affair between the French captain and the daughter of Vasiliki. It does not concern me, you are right; and if I have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the French captain, or the Count of AlbertdeMorcerf, but on the fisherman Fernand, the husband of Mercedes the Catalane.”

“Ah, sir!” cried the countess, “how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit!—for I am the only culprit, EdmondDantes, and if you owe revenge to anyone, it is to me, who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude.”

“But,” exclaimed EdmondDantes, “why was I absent? And why were you alone?”

 

“Because you had been arrested, EdmondDantes, and were a prisoner.”

“And why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?”

“I do not know,” said Mercedes.

“You do not, madame; at least, I hope not. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La Réserve, the day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.”

EdmondDantes went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue—this he placed in the hands of Mercedes. It was Danglars’ letter to the king’s attorney, which the EdmondDantes, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson & French, had taken from the file against EdmondDantes, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Mercedes read with terror the following lines:

“The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one EdmondDantes, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned EdmondDantes, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father’s abode. Should it not be found in possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said EdmondDantes on board the _Pharaon_.”


“How dreadful!” said Mercedes, passing her hand across her brow, moist with perspiration; “and that letter——”

“I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,” said EdmondDantes; “but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to you.”

“And the result of that letter——”

“You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long that arrest lasted. You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Château d’If. You do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of vengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not aware that you had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father had died of hunger!”

“Can it be?” cried Mercedes, shuddering.

“That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercedes and my deceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and—I have revenged myself.”

“And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?”

“I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides, that is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali. Compared with such things, what is the letter you have just read?—a lover’s deception, which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have married her. Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor, the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished; but I, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from my tomb, by the grace of God, to punish that man. He sends me for that purpose, and here I am.”

The poor woman’s head and arms fell; her legs bent under her, and she fell on her knees.

“Forgive, EdmondDantes, forgive for my sake, who love you still!”

The dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother. Her forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward and raised her. Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly countenance of EdmondDantes, on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression.

“Not crush that accursed race?” murmured he; “abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment? Impossible, madame, impossible!”

“EdmondDantes,” said the poor mother, who tried every means, “when I call you EdmondDantes, why do you not call me Mercedes?”

“Mercedes!” repeated EdmondDantes; “Mercedes! Well yes, you are right; that name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly. Oh, Mercedes, I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow, with the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen with cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it, consumed with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison. Mercedes, I must revenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,—fourteen years I wept, I cursed; now I tell you, Mercedes, I must revenge myself.”

The count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred.

“Revenge yourself, then, EdmondDantes,” cried the poor mother; “but let your vengeance fall on the culprits,—on him, on me, but not on my son!”

“It is written in the good book,” said EdmondDantes, “that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation. Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet, why should I seek to make myself better than God?”

“EdmondDantes,” continued Mercedes, with her arms extended towards the count, “since I first knew you, I have adored your name, have respected your memory. EdmondDantes, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart. EdmondDantes, if you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead! Yes, dead, alas! I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower, or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept! What could I do for you, EdmondDantes, besides pray and weep? Listen; for ten years I dreamed each night the same dream. I had been told that you had endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Château d’If, and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers. Well, EdmondDantes, I swear to you, by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pity,—EdmondDantes, for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold. And I, too, EdmondDantes—oh! believe me—guilty as I was—oh, yes, I, too, have suffered much!”

“Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence?” cried EdmondDantes, thrusting his hands into his hair; “have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?”

“No,” interrupted Mercedes, “but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son.”

Mercedes uttered these words with such deep anguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that EdmondDantes could not restrain a sob. The lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.

“What do you ask of me?” said he,—“your son’s life? Well, he shall live!”

Mercedes uttered a cry which made the tears start from EdmondDantes’s eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for, doubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them—far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir.

“Oh,” said she, seizing the count’s hand and raising it to her lips; “oh, thank you, thank you, EdmondDantes! Now you are exactly what I dreamt you were,—the man I always loved. Oh, now I may say so!”

“So much the better,” replied EdmondDantes; “as that poor EdmondDantes will not have long to be loved by you. Death is about to return to the tomb, the phantom to retire in darkness.”

“What do you say, EdmondDantes?”

“I say, since you command me, Mercedes, I must die.”

“Die? and why so? Who talks of dying? Whence have you these ideas of death?”

“You do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your son—challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory—you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live. What I most loved after you, Mercedes, was myself, my dignity, and that strength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my life. With one word you have crushed it, and I die.”

“But the duel will not take place, EdmondDantes, since you forgive?”

“It will take place,” said EdmondDantes, in a most solemn tone; “but instead of your son’s blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.”

Mercedes shrieked, and sprang towards EdmondDantes, but, suddenly stopping, “EdmondDantes,” said she, “there is a God above us, since you live and since I have seen you again; I trust to him from my heart. While waiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son should live, have you not?”

“Yes, madame, he shall live,” said EdmondDantes, surprised that without more emotion Mercedes had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her. Mercedes extended her hand to the count.

“EdmondDantes,” said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke, “how noble it is of you, how great the action you have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old with grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my EdmondDantes by a smile, or by a look, of that Mercedes whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating. Ah, believe me, EdmondDantes, as I told you, I too have suffered much; I repeat, it is melancholy to pass one’s life without having one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that proves that all is not yet over. No, it is not finished; I feel it by what remains in my heart. Oh, I repeat it, EdmondDantes; what you have just done is beautiful—it is grand; it is sublime.”

“Do you say so now, Mercedes?—then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you? Suppose that the Supreme Being, after having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was good—suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night—then—even then, Mercedes, you could not imagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment.”

Mercedes looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment, her admiration, and her gratitude. EdmondDantes pressed his forehead on his burning hands, as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts.

“EdmondDantes,” said Mercedes, “I have but one word more to say to you.”

The count smiled bitterly.

“EdmondDantes,” continued she, “you will see that if my face is pale, if my eyes are dull, if my beauty is gone; if Mercedes, in short, no longer resembles her former self in her features, you will see that her heart is still the same. Adieu, then, EdmondDantes; I have nothing more to ask of heaven—I have seen you again, and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were. Adieu, EdmondDantes, adieu, and thank you.”

But the count did not answer. Mercedes opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him.

The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Mercedes rolled away on the pavement of the Champs-Élysées, and made EdmondDantes raise his head.

“What a fool I was,” said he, “not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself!” 


After Mercedes had left EdmondDantes, he fell into profound gloom. Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped; his energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue.

“What?” said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom; “what? this edifice which I have been so long preparing, which I have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a single touch, a word, a breath! Yes, this self, of whom I thought so much, of whom I was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the Château d’If, and whom I had succeeded in making so great, will be but a lump of clay tomorrow. Alas, it is not the death of the body I regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to which everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,—is not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed, and which I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon? What is death for me? One step farther into rest,—two, perhaps, into silence. No, it is not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed to them, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God’s will that they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a world, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in Providence?

“And all this—all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman’s voice.

“Yet,” continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Mercedes had accepted, “yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some pathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.”

The blush of pride mounted to the count’s forehead as this thought passed through his mind.

“Ridiculous?” repeated he; “and the ridicule will fall on me. I ridiculous? No, I would rather die.”

By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercedes to spare her son, the count at last exclaimed:

“Folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at. He will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory,—and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,—it is important the world should know that I have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself. It must be; it shall be.”

Seizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and wrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will, made since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining the nature of his death.

“I do this, Oh, my God,” said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, “as much for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches, like AlbertdeMorcerf, Danglars, GerarddeVillefort, even AlbertdeMorcerf himself, must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy. Let them know, on the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by Providence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although they escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for eternity.”

While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking dreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of Providence.

It was just five o’clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his head, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality.

He arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haydee, who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his going out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot resist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching. The noise of the door did not awaken her, and EdmondDantes gazed at her with affectionate regret.

“She remembered that she had a son,” said he; “and I forgot I had a daughter.” Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, “Poor Haydee,” said he; “she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed something. Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I cannot die without confiding her to someone.”

He quietly regained his seat, and wrote under the other lines:

“I bequeath to MaximilianMorrel, captain of Spahis,—and son of my former patron, Pierre MaximilianMorrel, shipowner at Marseilles,—the sum of twenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister JulieMorrel and brother-in-law EmmanuelHerbault, if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness. These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at EdmondDantes, of which Bertuccio knows the secret. If his heart is free, and he will marry Haydee, the daughter of AliPasha of Yanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus accomplish my last wish. This will has already constituted Haydee heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in England, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants, may still amount to sixty millions.”   


He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and the pen fell from his hand.

“Haydee,” said he, “did you read it?”

“Oh, my lord,” said she, “why are you writing thus at such an hour? Why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are you going to leave me?”

“I am going on a journey, dear child,” said EdmondDantes, with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; “and if any misfortune should happen to me——”

The count stopped.

“Well?” asked the young girl, with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before, and which startled him.

“Well, if any misfortune happen to me,” replied EdmondDantes, “I wish my daughter to be happy.” Haydee smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head.

“Do you think of dying, my lord?” said she.

“The wise man, my child, has said, ‘It is good to think of death.’”

“Well, if you die,” said she, “bequeath your fortune to others, for if you die I shall require nothing;” and, taking the paper, she tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room. Then, the effort having exhausted her strength, she fell, not asleep this time, but fainting on the floor.

The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father.

“Alas,” murmured he, with intense suffering, “I might, then, have been happy yet.”

Then he carried Haydee to her room, resigned her to the care of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly this time, he again copied the destroyed will. As he was finishing, the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. EdmondDantes approached the window, and saw MaximilianMorrel and EmmanuelHerbault alight. “Good,” said he; “it was time,”—and he sealed his will with three seals.

A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open the door himself. MaximilianMorrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed.

“I am perhaps come too soon, count,” said he, “but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor has anyone in my house. I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance, to recover myself.”

EdmondDantes could not resist this proof of affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew to him with open arms.

“MaximilianMorrel,” said he, “it is a happy day for me, to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you. Good-morning, EmmanuelHerbault; you will come with me then, MaximilianMorrel?”

“Did you doubt it?” said the young captain.

“But if I were wrong——”

“I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I have been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself that justice must be on your side, or man’s countenance is no longer to be relied on.”

“But, MaximilianMorrel, AlbertdeMorcerf is your friend?”

“Simply an acquaintance, sir.”

“You met on the same day you first saw me?”

“Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me.”

“Thank you, MaximilianMorrel.” Then ringing the bell once, “Look.” said he to Ali, who came immediately, “take that to my solicitor. It is my will, MaximilianMorrel. When I am dead, you will go and examine it.”

“What?” said MaximilianMorrel, “you dead?”

“Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend? But what did you do yesterday after you left me?”

“I went to Tortoni’s, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud. I own I was seeking them.”

“Why, when all was arranged?”

“Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.”

“Did you doubt it!”

“No; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.”

“Well?”

“Well, I hoped to get an exchange of arms,—to substitute the sword for the pistol; the pistol is blind.”

“Have you succeeded?” asked EdmondDantes quickly, with an imperceptible gleam of hope.

“No; for your skill with the sword is so well known.”

“Ah?—who has betrayed me?”

“The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.”

“And you failed?”

“They positively refused.”

“MaximilianMorrel,” said the count, “have you ever seen me fire a pistol?”

“Never.”

“Well, we have time; look.” EdmondDantes took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercedes entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club. At each shot MaximilianMorrel turned pale. He examined the bullets with which EdmondDantes performed this dexterous feat, and saw that they were no larger than buckshot.

“It is astonishing,” said he. “Look, EmmanuelHerbault.” Then turning towards EdmondDantes, “Count,” said he, “in the name of all that is dear to you, I entreat you not to kill AlbertdeMorcerf!—the unhappy youth has a mother.”

“You are right,” said EdmondDantes; “and I have none.” These words were uttered in a tone which made MaximilianMorrel shudder.

“You are the offended party, count.”

“Doubtless; what does that imply?”

“That you will fire first.”

“I fire first?”

“Oh, I obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them to yield us that.”

“And at what distance?”

“Twenty paces.” A smile of terrible import passed over the count’s lips.

“MaximilianMorrel,” said he, “do not forget what you have just seen.”

“The only chance for AlbertdeMorcerf’s safety, then, will arise from your emotion.”

“I suffer from emotion?” said EdmondDantes.

“Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, I may say what would appear absurd to another.”

“What is that?”

“Break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him.”

“I will tell you, MaximilianMorrel,” said the count, “that I do not need entreating to spare the life of Fernand; he shall be so well spared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I——”

“And you?”

“That will be another thing; I shall be brought home.”

“No, no,” cried MaximilianMorrel, quite unable to restrain his feelings.

“As I told you, my dear MaximilianMorrel, Fernand will kill me.”

MaximilianMorrel looked at him in utter amazement. “But what has happened, then, since last evening, count?”

“The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi; I have seen a ghost.”

“And that ghost——”

“Told me, MaximilianMorrel, that I had lived long enough.”

MaximilianMorrel and EmmanuelHerbault looked at each other. EdmondDantes drew out his watch. “Let us go,” said he; “it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment was for eight o’clock.”

A carriage was in readiness at the door. EdmondDantes stepped into it with his two friends. He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door, and MaximilianMorrel and EmmanuelHerbault, who had considerately passed forward a few steps, thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within. As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting.

“We are first,” said MaximilianMorrel, looking out of the window.

“Excuse me, sir,” said Baptistin, who had followed his master with indescribable terror, “but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees.”

EdmondDantes sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to assist EmmanuelHerbault and MaximilianMorrel. The latter retained the count’s hand between his.

“I like,” said he, “to feel a hand like this, when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause.”

“It seems to me,” said EmmanuelHerbault, “that I see two young men down there, who are evidently, waiting.”

EdmondDantes drew MaximilianMorrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law.

“MaximilianMorrel,” said he, “are your affections disengaged?” MaximilianMorrel looked at EdmondDantes with astonishment. “I do not seek your confidence, my dear friend. I only ask you a simple question; answer it;—that is all I require.”

“I love a young girl, count.”

“Do you love her much?”

“More than my life.”

“Another hope defeated!” said the count. Then, with a sigh, “Poor Haydee!” murmured he.

“To tell the truth, count, if I knew less of you, I should think that you were less brave than you are.”

“Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving? Come, MaximilianMorrel, it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage. Do I regret life? What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death? Moreover, do not alarm yourself, MaximilianMorrel; this weakness, if it is such, is betrayed to you alone. I know the world is a drawing-room, from which we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts of honor paid.”

“That is to the purpose. Have you brought your arms?”

“I?—what for? I hope these gentlemen have theirs.”

“I will inquire,” said MaximilianMorrel.

“Do; but make no treaty—you understand me?”

“You need not fear.” MaximilianMorrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. The three young men bowed to each other courteously, if not affably.

“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said MaximilianMorrel, “but I do not see Fernand.”

“He sent us word this morning,” replied ChateauRenaud, “that he would meet us on the ground.”

“Ah,” said MaximilianMorrel. Beauchamp pulled out his watch.

“It is only five minutes past eight,” said he to MaximilianMorrel; “there is not much time lost yet.”

“Oh, I made no allusion of that kind,” replied MaximilianMorrel.

“There is a carriage coming,” said ChateauRenaud. It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled.

“You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? M. de EdmondDantes yields his right of using his.”

“We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count,” said Beauchamp, “and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. They are quite new, and have not yet been used. Will you examine them.”

“Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that Fernand does not know these pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient.”

“Gentlemen,” said ChateauRenaud, “it is not AlbertdeMorcerf coming in that carriage;—faith, it is FranzdEpinay and LucienDebray!”

The two young men he announced were indeed approaching. “What chance brings you here, gentlemen?” said ChateauRenaud, shaking hands with each of them.

“Because,” said LucienDebray, “AlbertdeMorcerf sent this morning to request us to come.” Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud exchanged looks of astonishment. “I think I understand his reason,” said MaximilianMorrel.

“What is it?”

“Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from Fernand, begging me to attend the Opera.”

“And I,” said LucienDebray.

“And I also,” said FranzdEpinay.

“And we, too,” added Beauchamp and ChateauRenaud.

“Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be present at the combat.”

“Exactly so,” said the young men; “you have probably guessed right.”

“But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,” said ChateauRenaud. “AlbertdeMorcerf is ten minutes after time.”

“There he comes,” said Beauchamp, “on horseback, at full gallop, followed by a servant.”

“How imprudent,” said ChateauRenaud, “to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols, after all the instructions I had given him.”

“And besides,” said Beauchamp, “with a collar above his cravat, an open coat and white waistcoat! Why has he not painted a spot upon his heart?—it would have been more simple.”

Meanwhile AlbertdeMorcerf had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men. He jumped from his horse, threw the bridle on his servant’s arms, and joined them. He was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he had not slept. A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance, which was not natural to him.

“I thank you, gentlemen,” said he, “for having complied with my request; I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship.” MaximilianMorrel had stepped back as AlbertdeMorcerf approached, and remained at a short distance. “And to you also, M. Morrel, my thanks are due. Come, there cannot be too many.”

 

“Sir,” said MaximilianMorrel, “you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de EdmondDantes’s friend?”

“I was not sure, but I thought it might be so. So much the better; the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied.”

“M. Morrel,” said ChateauRenaud, “will you apprise the EdmondDantes that Fernand is arrived, and we are at his disposal?”

MaximilianMorrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage.

“Stop, gentlemen,” said AlbertdeMorcerf; “I have two words to say to the EdmondDantes.”

“In private?” asked MaximilianMorrel.

“No, sir; before all who are here.”

AlbertdeMorcerf’s witnesses looked at each other. FranzdEpinay and LucienDebray exchanged some words in a whisper, and MaximilianMorrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident, went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with EmmanuelHerbault.

“What does he want with me?” said EdmondDantes.

“I do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.”

“Ah?” said EdmondDantes, “I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult!”

“I do not think that such is his intention,” said MaximilianMorrel.

The count advanced, accompanied by MaximilianMorrel and EmmanuelHerbault. His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to AlbertdeMorcerf’s grief-stricken face, who approached also, followed by the other four young men.

When at three paces distant from each other, AlbertdeMorcerf and the count stopped.

“Approach, gentlemen,” said AlbertdeMorcerf; “I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the EdmondDantes, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it, strange as it may appear to you.”

“Proceed, sir,” said the count.

“Sir,” said AlbertdeMorcerf, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually became firmer, “I reproached you with exposing the conduct of Fernand in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had no right to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that right. It is not Fernand’s treachery towards AliPasha which induces me so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its consequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you for not using greater severity.”

Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did AlbertdeMorcerf’s declaration. As for EdmondDantes, his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. He could not understand how AlbertdeMorcerf’s fiery nature, of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits, had suddenly stooped to this humiliation. He recognized the influence of Mercedes, and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless.

“Now, sir,” said AlbertdeMorcerf, “if you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand. Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault. But this confession concerns me only. I acted well as a man, but you have acted better than man. An angel alone could have saved one of us from death—that angel came from heaven, if not to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at least to make us esteem each other.”

EdmondDantes, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open, extended to AlbertdeMorcerf a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear.

“Gentlemen,” said he, “M. de EdmondDantes receives my apology. I had acted hastily towards him. Hasty actions are generally bad ones. Now my fault is repaired. I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated. But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me,” added he, drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies, “I shall endeavor to correct his mistake.”

“What happened during the night?” asked Beauchamp of ChateauRenaud; “we appear to make a very sorry figure here.”

“In truth, what AlbertdeMorcerf has just done is either very despicable or very noble,” replied the baron.

“What can it mean?” said LucienDebray to FranzdEpinay.

“EdmondDantes acts dishonorably to Fernand, and is justified by his son! Had I ten Yaninas in my family, I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times.”

As for EdmondDantes, his head was bent down, his arms were powerless. Bowing under the weight of twenty-four years’ reminiscences, he thought not of AlbertdeMorcerf, of Beauchamp, of ChateauRenaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son’s life, to whom he had offered his, and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret, capable of destroying forever in that young man’s heart every feeling of filial piety.

“Providence still,” murmured he; “now only am I fully convinced of being the emissary of God!” 


EdmondDantes bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with MaximilianMorrel and EmmanuelHerbault. AlbertdeMorcerf, Beauchamp, and ChateauRenaud remained alone. AlbertdeMorcerf looked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done.

“Indeed, my dear friend,” said Beauchamp first, who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation, “allow me to congratulate you; this is a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair.”

AlbertdeMorcerf remained silent and wrapped in thought. ChateauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane.

“Are we not going?” said he, after this embarrassing silence.

“When you please,” replied Beauchamp; “allow me only to compliment Fernand, who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity.”

“Oh, yes,” said ChateauRenaud.

“It is magnificent,” continued Beauchamp, “to be able to exercise so much self-control!”

“Assuredly; as for me, I should have been incapable of it,” said ChateauRenaud, with most significant coolness.

“Gentlemen,” interrupted AlbertdeMorcerf, “I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between M. de EdmondDantes and myself.”

“Possibly, possibly,” said Beauchamp immediately; “but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism, and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life. May I give you a friendly counsel? Set out for Naples, the Hague, or St. Petersburg—calm countries, where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot-headed Parisians. Seek quietude and oblivion, so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years. Am I not right, M. de ChateauRenaud?”

 

“That is quite my opinion,” said the gentleman; “nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn.”

“Thank you, gentlemen,” replied AlbertdeMorcerf, with a smile of indifference; “I shall follow your advice—not because you give it, but because I had before intended to quit France. I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds. It is deeply engraved on my heart, and, after what you have just said, I remember that only.”

ChateauRenaud and Beauchamp looked at each other; the impression was the same on both of them, and the tone in which AlbertdeMorcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.

“Good-bye, AlbertdeMorcerf,” said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his hand to the young man. The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand.

“Good-bye,” said ChateauRenaud in his turn, keeping his little cane in his left hand, and saluting with his right.

AlbertdeMorcerf’s lips scarcely whispered “Good-bye,” but his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger, proud disdain, and generous indignation. He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it, he mounted and galloped off in the direction of Paris.

In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder. As he alighted, he thought he saw his father’s pale face behind the curtain of the count’s bedroom. AlbertdeMorcerf turned away his head with a sigh, and went to his own apartments. He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy; he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and the landscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors. Then he took away his mother’s portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty. Then he arranged all his beautiful Turkish arms, his fine English guns, his Japanese china, his cups mounted in silver, his artistic bronzes by Feuchères or Barye; examined the cupboards, and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer of his secretaire, which he left open, all the pocket-money he had about him, and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel-boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything, and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table, after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there.

At the beginning of this work, his servant, notwithstanding orders to the contrary, came to his room.

“What do you want?” asked he, with a more sorrowful than angry tone.

“Pardon me, sir,” replied the valet; “you had forbidden me to disturb you, but the Count of AlbertdeMorcerf has called me.”

“Well!” said AlbertdeMorcerf.

“I did not like to go to him without first seeing you.”

“Why?”

“Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this morning.”

 

“It is probable,” said AlbertdeMorcerf.

“And since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what happened there. What must I answer?”

“The truth.”

“Then I shall say the duel did not take place?”

“You will say I apologized to the EdmondDantes. Go.”

The valet bowed and retired, and AlbertdeMorcerf returned to his inventory. As he was finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard, and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his attention. He approached the window, and saw his father get into it, and drive away. The door was scarcely closed when AlbertdeMorcerf bent his steps to his mother’s room; and, no one being there to announce him, he advanced to her bedchamber, and distressed by what he saw and guessed, stopped for one moment at the door.

As if the same idea had animated these two beings, Mercedes was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his. Everything was in order,—laces, dresses, jewels, linen, money, all were arranged in the drawers, and the countess was carefully collecting the keys. AlbertdeMorcerf saw all these preparations and understood them, and exclaiming, “My mother!” he threw his arms around her neck.

The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture. All these proofs of an energetic resolution, which AlbertdeMorcerf did not fear on his own account, alarmed him for his mother. “What are you doing?” asked he.

“What were you doing?” replied she.

“Oh, my mother!” exclaimed AlbertdeMorcerf, so overcome he could scarcely speak; “it is not the same with you and me—you cannot have made the same resolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house, and—and to you.”

“I also,” replied Mercedes, “am going, and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me; have I deceived myself?”

“Mother,” said AlbertdeMorcerf with firmness. “I cannot make you share the fate I have planned for myself. I must live henceforth without rank and fortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one. So, my dear mother, I am going at once to ask FranzdEpinay to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants.”

“You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger? Oh, do not say so; it will break my resolutions.”

“But not mine, mother,” replied AlbertdeMorcerf. “I am young and strong; I believe I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power of will. Alas, my dear mother, some have suffered so much, and yet live, and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them—on the fragments of all the hope which God had given them! I have seen that, mother; I know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors, and have punished them. No, mother; from this moment I have done with the past, and accept nothing from it—not even a name, because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another.”

“AlbertdeMorcerf, my child,” said Mercedes, “if I had a stronger heart, that is the counsel I would have given you; your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak; listen to its dictates. You had friends, AlbertdeMorcerf; break off their acquaintance. But do not despair; you have life before you, my dear AlbertdeMorcerf, for you are yet scarcely twenty-two years old; and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name, take my father’s—it was Herrera. I am sure, my dear AlbertdeMorcerf, whatever may be your career, you will soon render that name illustrious. Then, my son, return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if I am wrong, still let me cherish these hopes, for I have no future to look forward to. For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this house.”

“I will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother,” said the young man. “Yes, I share your hopes; the anger of Heaven will not pursue us, since you are pure and I am innocent. But, since our resolution is formed, let us act promptly. Fernand went out about half an hour ago; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation.”

“I am ready, my son,” said Mercedes.

AlbertdeMorcerf ran to fetch a carriage. He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des Saints-Pères, where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging, and thither he intended conducting the countess. As the carriage stopped at the door, and AlbertdeMorcerf was alighting, a man approached and gave him a letter.

AlbertdeMorcerf recognized the bearer. “From the count,” said Bertuccio. AlbertdeMorcerf took the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for Bertuccio, but he was gone.

He returned to Mercedes with tears in his eyes and heaving breast, and without uttering a word he gave her the letter. Mercedes read:

“AlbertdeMorcerf,—While showing you that I have discovered your plans, I hope also to convince you of my delicacy. You are free, you leave the count’s house, and you take your mother to your home; but reflect, AlbertdeMorcerf, you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her. Keep the struggle for yourself, bear all the suffering, but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts; for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her, and Providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty. I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with you. Do not seek to know how I discovered it; I know it—that is sufficient.

“Now, listen, AlbertdeMorcerf. Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and joyful, to my country. I had a betrothed, AlbertdeMorcerf, a lovely girl whom I adored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined it for her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on the Allées de Meilhan. Your mother, AlbertdeMorcerf, knows that poor house well. A short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure. The iron box was there—no one had touched it—under a beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born, which overshadowed the spot. Well, AlbertdeMorcerf, this money, which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored, may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be devoted to the same purpose.

“Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor woman, but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved. You are a generous man, AlbertdeMorcerf, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment; if you refuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you, I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair.”

AlbertdeMorcerf stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter. Mercedes turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven.

“I accept it,” said she; “he has a right to pay the dowry, which I shall take with me to some convent!”

Putting the letter in her bosom, she took her son’s arm, and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs. 


Meanwhile EdmondDantes had also returned to town with EmmanuelHerbault and MaximilianMorrel. Their return was cheerful. EmmanuelHerbault did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his expressions of delight. MaximilianMorrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed his brother-in-law’s gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt equal inward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his countenance.

At the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there, motionless as a sentinel at his post. EdmondDantes put his head out of the window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the steward disappeared.

“Count,” said EmmanuelHerbault, when they were at the end of the Place Royale, “put me down at my door, that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours.”

“If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph, said MaximilianMorrel, I would invite the count to our house; besides that, he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort. So we will take leave of our friend, and let him hasten home.”

“Stop a moment,” said EdmondDantes; “do not let me lose both my companions. Return, EmmanuelHerbault, to your charming wife, and present my best compliments to her; and do you, MaximilianMorrel, accompany me to the Champs-Élysées.”

“Willingly,” said MaximilianMorrel; “particularly as I have business in that quarter.”

“Shall we wait breakfast for you?” asked EmmanuelHerbault.

“No,” replied the young man. The door was closed, and the carriage proceeded. “See what good fortune I brought you!” said MaximilianMorrel, when he was alone with the count. “Have you not thought so?”

“Yes,” said EdmondDantes; “for that reason I wished to keep you near me.”

“It is miraculous!” continued MaximilianMorrel, answering his own thoughts.

“What?” said EdmondDantes.

“What has just happened.”

“Yes,” said the Count, “you are right—it is miraculous.”

“For AlbertdeMorcerf is brave,” resumed MaximilianMorrel.

“Very brave,” said EdmondDantes; “I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head.”

“And I know he has fought two duels,” said MaximilianMorrel. “How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning?”

“All owing to your influence,” replied EdmondDantes, smiling.

“It is well for AlbertdeMorcerf he is not in the army,” said MaximilianMorrel.

“Why?”

“An apology on the ground!” said the young captain, shaking his head.

“Come,” said the count mildly, “do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men, MaximilianMorrel! Acknowledge, that if AlbertdeMorcerf is brave, he cannot be a coward; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning, and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise.”

“Doubtless, doubtless,” said MaximilianMorrel; “but I shall say, like the Spaniard, ‘He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday.’”

“You will breakfast with me, will you not, MaximilianMorrel?” said the count, to turn the conversation.

“No; I must leave you at ten o’clock.”

“Your engagement was for breakfast, then?” said the count.

MaximilianMorrel smiled, and shook his head.

“Still you must breakfast somewhere.”

“But if I am not hungry?” said the young man.

“Oh,” said the count, “I only know two things which destroy the appetite,—grief—and as I am happy to see you very cheerful, it is not that—and love. Now after what you told me this morning of your heart, I may believe——”

“Well, count,” replied MaximilianMorrel gayly, “I will not dispute it.”

“But you will not make me your confidant, MaximilianMorrel?” said the count, in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret.

“I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?” EdmondDantes only answered by extending his hand to the young man. “Well,” continued the latter, “since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes, it is elsewhere, and I must go and find it.”

“Go,” said the count deliberately; “go, dear friend, but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world, that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love, and that I love you, MaximilianMorrel.”

 

“I will remember it,” said the young man, “as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid. When I need your assistance, and the moment arrives, I will come to you, count.”

“Well, I rely upon your promise. Good-bye, then.”

“Good-bye, till we meet again.”

They had arrived in the Champs-Élysées. EdmondDantes opened the carriage-door, MaximilianMorrel sprang out on the pavement, Bertuccio was waiting on the steps. MaximilianMorrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny, and EdmondDantes hastened to join Bertuccio.

“Well?” asked he.

“She is going to leave her house,” said the steward.

“And her son?”

“Florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same.”

“Come this way.” EdmondDantes took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the letter we have seen, and gave it to the steward. “Go,” said he quickly. “But first, let Haydee be informed that I have returned.”

“Here I am,” said the young girl, who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely. Bertuccio left. Every transport of a daughter finding a father, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt by Haydee during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so eagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, EdmondDantes’s joy was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent.

EdmondDantes was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Mercedes in the world, and he might yet be happy. His eye, elate with happiness, was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Haydee, when suddenly the door opened. The count knit his brow.

“Fernand!” said Baptistin, as if that name sufficed for his excuse. In fact, the count’s face brightened.

“Which,” asked he, “the viscount or the count?”

“The count.”

“Oh,” exclaimed Haydee, “is it not yet over?”

“I know not if it is finished, my beloved child,” said EdmondDantes, taking the young girl’s hands; “but I do know you have nothing more to fear.”

“But it is the wretched——”

“That man cannot injure me, Haydee,” said EdmondDantes; “it was his son alone that there was cause to fear.”

“And what I have suffered,” said the young girl, “you shall never know, my lord.”

EdmondDantes smiled. “By my father’s tomb,” said he, extending his hand over the head of the young girl, “I swear to you, Haydee, that if any misfortune happens, it will not be to me.”

“I believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if God had spoken to me,” said the young girl, presenting her forehead to him. EdmondDantes pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once, the one violently, the other secretly.

“Oh,” murmured the count, “shall I then be permitted to love again? Ask Fernand into the drawing-room,” said he to Baptistin, while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase.

We must explain this visit, which although expected by EdmondDantes, is unexpected to our readers. While Mercedes, as we have said, was making a similar inventory of her property to AlbertdeMorcerf’s, while she was arranging her jewels, shutting her drawers, collecting her keys, to leave everything in perfect order, she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage, from which everything could be both seen and heard. He who was thus looking, without being heard or seen, probably heard and saw all that passed in Mercedes’s apartments. From that glass door the pale-faced man went to the count’s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard. He remained there ten minutes, motionless and dumb, listening to the beating of his own heart. For him those ten minutes were very long. It was then AlbertdeMorcerf, returning from his meeting with the count, perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain, and turned aside. The count’s eye expanded; he knew AlbertdeMorcerf had insulted the count dreadfully, and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel. AlbertdeMorcerf returned safely—then the count was revenged.

An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb. But as we have said, he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph. He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father’s honor; but when that was done, why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms?

It was then, when the count could not see AlbertdeMorcerf, that he sent for his servant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him. Ten minutes afterwards, General AlbertdeMorcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. He had apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and, shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. The coachman stooped down for his orders.

“To the Champs-Élysées,” said the general; “the EdmondDantes’s. Hurry!”

The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped before the count’s door. Fernand opened the door himself, and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the open door with his servant.

A moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of AlbertdeMorcerf to EdmondDantes, and the latter, leading Haydee aside, ordered that AlbertdeMorcerf be asked into the drawing-room. The general was pacing the room the third time when, in turning, he perceived EdmondDantes at the door.

“Ah, it is Fernand,” said EdmondDantes quietly; “I thought I had not heard aright.”

“Yes, it is I,” said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely.

“May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing Fernand so early?”

“Had you not a meeting with my son this morning?” asked the general.

“I had,” replied the count.

“And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you, and to endeavor to kill you.”

“Yes, sir, he had very good ones; but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me, and did not even fight.”

“Yet he considered you the cause of his father’s dishonor, the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house.”

“It is true, sir,” said EdmondDantes with his dreadful calmness; “a secondary cause, but not the principal.”

“Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?”

“I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me.”

“But to what do you attribute this conduct?”

“To the conviction, probably, that there was one more guilty than I.”

“And who was that?”

“His father.”

“That may be,” said the count, turning pale; “but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted.”

“I know it, and I expected this result.”

“You expected my son would be a coward?” cried the count.

“M. AlbertdeMorcerf is no coward!” said EdmondDantes.

“A man who holds a sword in his hand, and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword, and does not fight, is a coward! Why is he not here that I may tell him so?”

“Sir,” replied EdmondDantes coldly, “I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs. Go and tell M. AlbertdeMorcerf that, and he may know what to answer you.”

“Oh, no, no,” said the general, smiling faintly, “I did not come for that purpose; you are right. I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my enemy. I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively; that it seems as if I had always known you, and always hated you; and, in short, since the young people of the present day will not fight, it remains for us to do so. Do you think so, sir?”

“Certainly. And when I told you I had foreseen the result, it is the honor of your visit I alluded to.”

“So much the better. Are you prepared?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead,” said the general, whose teeth were clenched with rage.

 

“Until one of us dies,” repeated EdmondDantes, moving his head slightly up and down.

“Let us start, then; we need no witnesses.”

“Very true,” said EdmondDantes; “it is unnecessary, we know each other so well!”

“On the contrary,” said the count, “we know so little of each other.”

“Indeed?” said EdmondDantes, with the same indomitable coolness; “let us see. Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of Waterloo? Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain? Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali? And have not all these Fernands, united, made Lieutenant-General, the Count of AlbertdeMorcerf, peer of France?”

“Oh,” cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, “wretch,—to reproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me! No, I did not say I was a stranger to you. I know well, demon, that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past, and that you have read, by the light of what torch I know not, every page of my life; but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings. No—no, I am aware you know me; but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery. You call yourself, in Paris, the EdmondDantes; in Italy, EdmondDantes; in Malta, I forget what. But it is your real name I want to know, in the midst of your hundred names, that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight, at the moment when I plunge my sword through your heart.”

EdmondDantes turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire. He leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat and waistcoat, he put on a sailor’s jacket and hat, from beneath which rolled his long black hair. He returned thus, formidable and implacable, advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general, who could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him again, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him, drew back, and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand.

“Fernand,” cried he, “of my hundred names I need only tell you one, to overwhelm you! But you guess it now, do you not?—or, rather, you remember it? For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures, I show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again—a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with Mercedes, my betrothed!”

 

The general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed, looked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to support him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door, through which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful, lamentable, distressing cry:

“EdmondDantes!”

Then, with sighs which were unlike any human sound, he dragged himself to the door, reeled across the courtyard, and falling into the arms of his valet, he said in a voice scarcely intelligible,—“Home, home.”

The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants, partly recalled his senses, but the ride was short, and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived. He stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted. The door was wide open, a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of the yard—a strange sight before so noble a mansion; the count looked at it with terror, but without daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed towards his apartment.

Two persons were coming down the stairs; he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them. It was Mercedes leaning on her son’s arm and leaving the house. They passed close by the unhappy being, who, concealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercedes dress brush past him, and his son’s warm breath, pronouncing these words:

“Courage, mother! Come, this is no longer our home!”

The words died away, the steps were lost in the distance. The general drew himself up, clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son. He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney-coach, then the coachman’s voice, and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows. He darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world; but the hackney-coach drove on and the head of neither Mercedes nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband.

And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window, which was broken by the explosion.

 

 We may easily conceive where MaximilianMorrel’s appointment was. On leaving EdmondDantes he walked slowly towards GerarddeVillefort’s; we say slowly, for MaximilianMorrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he had hastened to take leave of EdmondDantes because he wished to be alone with his thoughts. He knew his time well—the hour when ValentinedeVillefort was giving NoirtierdeVillefort his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty. NoirtierdeVillefort and ValentinedeVillefort had given him leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that permission.

He arrived; ValentinedeVillefort was expecting him. Uneasy and almost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This uneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report AlbertdeMorcerf’s adventure had made in the world, for the affair at the Opera was generally known. No one at GerarddeVillefort’s doubted that a duel would ensue from it. ValentinedeVillefort, with her woman’s instinct, guessed that MaximilianMorrel would be EdmondDantes’s second, and from the young man’s well-known courage and his great affection for the count, she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and received; and MaximilianMorrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected.

“Now,” said ValentinedeVillefort, motioning to MaximilianMorrel to sit down near her grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,—“now let us talk about our own affairs. You know, MaximilianMorrel, grandpapa once thought of leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from GerarddeVillefort’s.”

“Yes,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I recollect the project, of which I highly approved.”

“Well,” said ValentinedeVillefort, “you may approve again, for grandpapa is again thinking of it.”

“Bravo,” said MaximilianMorrel.

 

“And do you know,” said ValentinedeVillefort, “what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house.” NoirtierdeVillefort looked at ValentinedeVillefort to impose silence, but she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for MaximilianMorrel.

“Oh, whatever may be NoirtierdeVillefort’s reason,” answered MaximilianMorrel, “I can readily believe it to be a good one.”

“An excellent one,” said ValentinedeVillefort. “He pretends the air of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré is not good for me.”

“Indeed?” said MaximilianMorrel; “in that NoirtierdeVillefort may be right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight.”

“Not very,” said ValentinedeVillefort. “And grandpapa has become my physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.”

“Do you then really suffer?” asked MaximilianMorrel quickly.

“Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that is all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something.” NoirtierdeVillefort did not lose a word of what ValentinedeVillefort said.

“And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?”

“A very simple one,” said ValentinedeVillefort. “I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say one spoonful, I began by one—now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a panacea.” ValentinedeVillefort smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.

MaximilianMorrel, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a yellowish hue.

From ValentinedeVillefort the young man looked towards NoirtierdeVillefort. The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her affection, and he also, like MaximilianMorrel, followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover.

“But,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I thought this mixture, of which you now take four spoonfuls, was prepared for NoirtierdeVillefort?”

“I know it is very bitter,” said ValentinedeVillefort; “so bitter, that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.” NoirtierdeVillefort looked inquiringly at his granddaughter. “Yes, grandpapa,” said ValentinedeVillefort; “it is so. Just now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.” NoirtierdeVillefort turned pale, and made a sign that he wished to speak.

ValentinedeVillefort rose to fetch the dictionary. NoirtierdeVillefort watched her with evident anguish. In fact, the blood was rushing to the young girl’s head already, her cheeks were becoming red.

“Oh,” cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, “this is singular! I can’t see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?” And she leaned against the window.

“The sun is not shining,” said MaximilianMorrel, more alarmed by NoirtierdeVillefort’s expression than by ValentinedeVillefort’s indisposition. He ran towards her. The young girl smiled.

“Cheer up,” said she to NoirtierdeVillefort. “Do not be alarmed, MaximilianMorrel; it is nothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard?” She opened NoirtierdeVillefort’s door, ran to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. “Yes,” said she, “it is HermineDanglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. Good-bye;—I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell till I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, MaximilianMorrel; I promise you not to persuade them to stay.”

 

MaximilianMorrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to HeloisedeVillefort’s apartments and to hers. As soon as she was gone, NoirtierdeVillefort made a sign to MaximilianMorrel to take the dictionary. MaximilianMorrel obeyed; guided by ValentinedeVillefort, he had learned how to understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to the work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words,

“Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from ValentinedeVillefort’s room.”

MaximilianMorrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois’s situation, and in NoirtierdeVillefort’s name gave that order. The servant soon returned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. NoirtierdeVillefort made a sign that he wished to speak.

“Why are the glass and decanter empty?” asked he; “ValentinedeVillefort said she only drank half the glassful.”

The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.

“I do not know,” said the servant, “but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle ValentinedeVillefort’s room: perhaps she has emptied them.”

“Ask her,” said MaximilianMorrel, translating NoirtierdeVillefort’s thought this time by his look. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately. “Mademoiselle ValentinedeVillefort passed through the room to go to HeloisedeVillefort’s,” said he; “and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank what remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master EdwarddeVillefort had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.”

NoirtierdeVillefort raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. From that moment the old man’s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.

It was indeed HermineDanglars and her daughter whom ValentinedeVillefort had seen; they had been ushered into HeloisedeVillefort’s room, who had said she would receive them there. That is why ValentinedeVillefort passed through her room, which was on a level with ValentinedeVillefort’s, and only separated from it by EdwarddeVillefort’s. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly people manner is contagious. HeloisedeVillefort received them with equal solemnity. ValentinedeVillefort entered at this moment, and the formalities were resumed.

“My dear friend,” said the HermineDanglars, while the two young people were shaking hands, “I and EugenieDanglars are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with AndreaCavalcanti.” Danglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker found that it answered better than count.

“Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,” replied HeloisedeVillefort. “AndreaCavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities.”

 

“Listen,” said the HermineDanglars, smiling; “speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic—that is his word.”

“And then,” said EugenieDanglars, while turning over the leaves of HeloisedeVillefort’s album, “add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man.”

“And,” said HeloisedeVillefort, “I need not ask you if you share that fancy.”

“I?” replied EugenieDanglars with her usual candor. “Oh, not the least in the world, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in heart, in person, and in thought.”

EugenieDanglars pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to ValentinedeVillefort’s cheeks. The timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman.

“At any rate,” said she, “since I am to be married whether I will or not, I ought to be thankful to Providence for having released me from my engagement with M. AlbertdeMorcerf, or I should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man.”

“It is true,” said the HermineDanglars, with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them,—“it is very true that had not the Morcerfs hesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur AlbertdeMorcerf. The general depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars. We have had a narrow escape.”

“But,” said ValentinedeVillefort, timidly, “does all the father’s shame revert upon the son? Monsieur AlbertdeMorcerf appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general.”

“Excuse me,” said the implacable young girl, “Monsieur AlbertdeMorcerf claims and well deserves his share. It appears that after having challenged M. de EdmondDantes at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground today.”

“Impossible,” said HeloisedeVillefort.

“Ah, my dear friend,” said HermineDanglars, with the same simplicity we before noticed, “it is a fact. I heard it from M. LucienDebray, who was present at the explanation.”

ValentinedeVillefort also knew the truth, but she did not answer. A single word had reminded her that MaximilianMorrel was expecting her in NoirtierdeVillefort’s room. Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation, ValentinedeVillefort had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation. She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly HermineDanglars’ hand, pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.

“What is it?” said she, starting at HermineDanglars’ touch as she would have done from an electric shock.

“It is, my dear ValentinedeVillefort,” said the HermineDanglars, “that you are, doubtless, suffering.”

 

“I?” said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.

“Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red successively, three or four times in one minute.”

“Indeed,” cried EugenieDanglars, “you are very pale!”

“Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.” Artless as she was, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and besides, HeloisedeVillefort came to her assistance.

“Retire, ValentinedeVillefort,” said she; “you are really suffering, and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.”

ValentinedeVillefort kissed EugenieDanglars, bowed to HermineDanglars, who had already risen to take her leave, and went out.

“That poor child,” said HeloisedeVillefort when ValentinedeVillefort was gone, “she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness.”

Meanwhile, ValentinedeVillefort, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand, had crossed EdwarddeVillefort’s room without noticing some trick of the child, and through her own had reached the little staircase.

She was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard MaximilianMorrel’s voice, when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor. MaximilianMorrel bounded to the door, opened it, and found ValentinedeVillefort stretched out at the bottom of the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair. ValentinedeVillefort opened her eyes.

“Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,” said she with feverish volubility; “I don’t know my way. I forgot there were three more steps before the landing.”

“You have hurt yourself, perhaps,” said MaximilianMorrel. “What can I do for you, ValentinedeVillefort?”

ValentinedeVillefort looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in NoirtierdeVillefort’s eyes.

“Don’t worry, dear grandpapa,” said she, endeavoring to smile; “it is nothing—it is nothing; I was giddy, that is all.”

“Another attack of giddiness,” said MaximilianMorrel, clasping his hands. “Oh, attend to it, ValentinedeVillefort, I entreat you.”

“But no,” said ValentinedeVillefort,—“no, I tell you it is all past, and it was nothing. Now, let me tell you some news; EugenieDanglars is to be married in a week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal festival. We are all invited, my father, HeloisedeVillefort, and I—at least, I understood it so.”

“When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, ValentinedeVillefort, you who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him answer—Soon.”

“And do you,” said ValentinedeVillefort, “depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa?”

“Yes,” cried MaximilianMorrel, “make haste. So long as you are not mine, ValentinedeVillefort, I shall always think I may lose you.”

“Oh,” replied ValentinedeVillefort with a convulsive movement, “oh, indeed, MaximilianMorrel, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who, they say, never knows fear. Ha, ha, ha!”

She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and twisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless. The cry of terror which was stopped on NoirtierdeVillefort’s lips, seemed to start from his eyes. MaximilianMorrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance. The young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle ValentinedeVillefort’s room, and the servant who had replaced Barrois, ran in at the same moment. ValentinedeVillefort was so pale, so cold, so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage crying for help. HermineDanglars and EugenieDanglars were going out at that moment; they heard the cause of the disturbance.

“I told you so!” exclaimed HeloisedeVillefort. “Poor child!”

 

 At the same moment GerarddeVillefort’s voice was heard calling from his study, “What is the matter?”

MaximilianMorrel looked at NoirtierdeVillefort who had recovered his self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge. He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur’s footstep was heard in the passage.

GerarddeVillefort sprang into the room, ran to ValentinedeVillefort, and took her in his arms.

“A physician, a physician,—M. d’Avrigny!” cried GerarddeVillefort; “or rather I will go for him myself.”

He flew from the apartment, and MaximilianMorrel at the same moment darted out at the other door. He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection—the conversation he had heard between the doctor and GerarddeVillefort the night of MadamedeSaintMeran’s death, recurred to him; these symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois. At the same time EdmondDantes’s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before, “Whatever you want, MaximilianMorrel, come to me; I have great power.”

More rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.

Meanwhile GerarddeVillefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d’Avrigny’s door. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed. GerarddeVillefort ran upstairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and let him pass, only calling to him:

“In his study, Monsieur Procureur—in his study!” GerarddeVillefort pushed, or rather forced, the door open.

“Ah,” said the doctor, “is it you?”

“Yes,” said GerarddeVillefort, closing the door after him, “it is I, who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my house is accursed!”

“What?” said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion, “have you another invalid?”

“Yes, doctor,” cried GerarddeVillefort, clutching his hair, “yes!”

D’Avrigny’s look implied, “I told you it would be so.” Then he slowly uttered these words, “Who is now dying in your house? What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God?”

A mournful sob burst from GerarddeVillefort’s heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his arm,—“ValentinedeVillefort,” said he, “it is ValentinedeVillefort’s turn!”

 

“Your daughter!” cried d’Avrigny with grief and surprise.

“You see you were deceived,” murmured the magistrate; “come and see her, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her.”

“Each time you have applied to me,” said the doctor, “it has been too late; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost.”

“Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with weakness. This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.”

“Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,” said d’Avrigny. “Come.”

The same cabriolet which had brought GerarddeVillefort took them back at full speed, and at this moment MaximilianMorrel rapped at EdmondDantes’s door.

The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name of MaximilianMorrel, who had left him only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose, and sprang to meet him.

“What is the matter, MaximilianMorrel?” asked he; “you are pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead.” MaximilianMorrel fell into a chair.

“Yes,” said he, “I came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.”

“Are all your family well?” asked the count, with an affectionate benevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.

“Thank you, count—thank you,” said the young man, evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation; “yes, everyone in my family is well.”

“So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?” replied the count with increased anxiety.

“Yes,” said MaximilianMorrel, “it is true; I have but now left a house where death has just entered, to run to you.”

“Are you then come from Fernand’s?” asked EdmondDantes.

“No,” said MaximilianMorrel; “is someone dead in his house?”

“The general has just blown his brains out,” replied EdmondDantes with great coolness.

“Oh, what a dreadful event!” cried MaximilianMorrel.

“Not for the countess, or for AlbertdeMorcerf,” said EdmondDantes; “a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one,—blood washes out shame.”

“Poor countess,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I pity her very much; she is so noble a woman!”

“Pity AlbertdeMorcerf also, MaximilianMorrel; for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess. But let us return to yourself. You have hastened to me—can I have the happiness of being useful to you?”

 

“Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me.”

“Tell me what it is,” replied EdmondDantes.

“Oh,” said MaximilianMorrel, “I know not, indeed, if I may reveal this secret to mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me, count——” MaximilianMorrel hesitated.

“Do you think I love you?” said EdmondDantes, taking the young man’s hand affectionately in his.

“Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,” placing his hand on his heart, “that I ought to have no secret from you.”

“You are right, MaximilianMorrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your heart speaks to you. Tell me what it says.”

“Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone you know?”

“I am at your service, and still more my servants.”

“Oh, I cannot live if she is not better.”

“Shall I ring for Baptistin?”

“No, I will go and speak to him myself.” MaximilianMorrel went out, called Baptistin, and whispered a few words to him. The valet ran directly.

“Well, have you sent?” asked EdmondDantes, seeing MaximilianMorrel return.

“Yes, and now I shall be more calm.”

“You know I am waiting,” said EdmondDantes, smiling.

“Yes, and I will tell you. One evening I was in a garden; a clump of trees concealed me; no one suspected I was there. Two persons passed near me—allow me to conceal their names for the present; they were speaking in an undertone, and yet I was so interested in what they said that I did not lose a single word.”

“This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering, MaximilianMorrel.”

“Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend. Someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged. One of the persons whose conversation I overheard was the master of the house; the other, the physician. The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear, for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel, as an object of God’s anger.”

“Ah, indeed?” said EdmondDantes, looking earnestly at the young man, and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on MaximilianMorrel’s face.

“Yes,” continued MaximilianMorrel, “death had entered that house twice within one month.”

“And what did the doctor answer?” asked EdmondDantes.

“He replied—he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must be attributed”—

“To what?”

“To poison.”

“Indeed!” said EdmondDantes with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor, or the intense interest with which he listened; “indeed, MaximilianMorrel, did you hear that?”

“Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.”

EdmondDantes listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness.

“Well,” said MaximilianMorrel, “death came a third time, and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this secret?”

“My dear friend,” said EdmondDantes, “you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart. I know the house where you heard it, or one very similar to it; a house with a garden, a master, a physician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths. Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that as well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it does not concern me. You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to God’s anger—well, who says your supposition is not reality? Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over. If it is God’s justice, instead of his anger, which is walking through that house, MaximilianMorrel, turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose.”

MaximilianMorrel shuddered. There was something mournful, solemn, and terrible in the count’s manner.

“Besides,” continued he, in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking—“besides, who says that it will begin again?”

“It has returned, count,” exclaimed MaximilianMorrel; “that is why I hastened to you.”

“Well, what do you wish me to do? Do you wish me, for instance, to give information to the procureur?” EdmondDantes uttered the last words with so much meaning that MaximilianMorrel, starting up, cried out:

“You know of whom I speak, count, do you not?”

“Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by putting the dots to the _i_, or rather by naming the persons. You were walking one evening in GerarddeVillefort’s garden; from what you relate, I suppose it to have been the evening of MadamedeSaintMeran’s death. You heard GerarddeVillefort talking to M. d’Avrigny about the death of M. de MadamedeSaintMeran, and that no less surprising, of the countess. M. d’Avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison; and you, honest man, have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret. We are no longer in the Middle Ages; there is no longer a Vehmgericht, or Free Tribunals; what do you want to ask these people? ‘Conscience, what hast thou to do with me?’ as Sterne said. My dear fellow, let them sleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale in their drowsiness, if they are disposed to do so, and pray do you remain in peace, who have no remorse to disturb you.”

Deep grief was depicted on MaximilianMorrel’s features; he seized EdmondDantes’s hand. “But it is beginning again, I say!”

“Well,” said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which he could not understand, and looking still more earnestly at MaximilianMorrel, “let it begin again,—it is like the house of the Atreidae;19 God has condemned them, and they must submit to their punishment. They will all disappear, like the fabrics children build with cards, and which fall, one by one, under the breath of their builder, even if there are two hundred of them. Three months since it was M. de MadamedeSaintMeran; MadamedeSaintMeran two months since; the other day it was Barrois; today, the old NoirtierdeVillefort, or young ValentinedeVillefort.”

“You knew it?” cried MaximilianMorrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that EdmondDantes started,—he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved; “you knew it, and said nothing?”

“And what is it to me?” replied EdmondDantes, shrugging his shoulders; “do I know those people? and must I lose the one to save the other? Faith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice.”

“But I,” cried MaximilianMorrel, groaning with sorrow, “I love her!”

“You love?—whom?” cried EdmondDantes, starting to his feet, and seizing the two hands which MaximilianMorrel was raising towards heaven.

“I love most fondly—I love madly—I love as a man who would give his life-blood to spare her a tear—I love ValentinedeVillefort, who is being murdered at this moment! Do you understand me? I love her; and I ask God and you how I can save her?”

EdmondDantes uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion. “Unhappy man,” cried he, wringing his hands in his turn; “you love ValentinedeVillefort,—that daughter of an accursed race!”

Never had MaximilianMorrel witnessed such an expression—never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face—never had the genius of terror he had so often seen, either on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of Algeria, shaken around him more dreadful fire. He drew back terrified.

As for EdmondDantes, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun’s genial influence when the cloud has passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about twenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face.

“See,” said he, “my dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes to their view. I, who was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,—I, who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy,—I, who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy (a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful), I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course I was watching, and bitten to the heart!”

MaximilianMorrel groaned.

“Come, come,” continued the count, “complaints are unavailing, be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will watch over you.”

MaximilianMorrel shook his head sorrowfully.

“I tell you to hope. Do you understand me?” cried EdmondDantes. “Remember that I never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived. It is twelve o’clock, MaximilianMorrel; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening, or tomorrow morning. Listen, MaximilianMorrel—it is noon; if ValentinedeVillefort is not now dead, she will not die.”

“How so?” cried MaximilianMorrel, “when I left her dying?”

EdmondDantes pressed his hands to his forehead. What was passing in that brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets? What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous? God only knows.

EdmondDantes raised his head once more, and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep.

“MaximilianMorrel,” said he, “return home. I command you not to stir—attempt nothing, not to let your countenance betray a thought, and I will send you tidings. Go.”

“Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness. Have you, then, power against death? Are you superhuman? Are you an angel?” And the young man, who had never shrunk from danger, shrank before EdmondDantes with indescribable terror. But EdmondDantes looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile, that MaximilianMorrel felt the tears filling his eyes.

“I can do much for you, my friend,” replied the count. “Go; I must be alone.”

MaximilianMorrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy EdmondDantes exercised over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. He pressed the count’s hand and left. He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin, whom he saw in the Rue Matignon, and who was running.

Meanwhile, GerarddeVillefort and d’Avrigny had made all possible haste, ValentinedeVillefort had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold. GerarddeVillefort, closely watching his countenance and his lips, awaited the result of the examination. NoirtierdeVillefort, paler than even the young girl, more eager than GerarddeVillefort for the decision, was watching also intently and affectionately.

At last d’Avrigny slowly uttered these words: “She is still alive!”

“Still?” cried GerarddeVillefort; “oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.”

“Yes,” said the physician, “I repeat it; she is still alive, and I am astonished at it.”

“But is she safe?” asked the father.

“Yes, since she lives.”

At that moment d’Avrigny’s glance met NoirtierdeVillefort’s eye. It glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of thought, that the physician was struck. He placed the young girl again on the chair,—her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and white, as well as her whole face,—and remained motionless, looking at NoirtierdeVillefort, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did.

“Sir,” said d’Avrigny to GerarddeVillefort, “call Mademoiselle ValentinedeVillefort’s maid, if you please.”

GerarddeVillefort went himself to find her; and d’Avrigny approached NoirtierdeVillefort.

“Have you something to tell me?” asked he. The old man winked his eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval.

“Privately?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I will remain with you.” At this moment GerarddeVillefort returned, followed by the lady’s maid; and after her came HeloisedeVillefort.

“What is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me, and she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously of it.”

The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother, approached ValentinedeVillefort and took her hand. D’Avrigny continued to look at NoirtierdeVillefort; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead.

“Ah,” said he, involuntarily following NoirtierdeVillefort’s eyes, which were fixed on HeloisedeVillefort, who repeated:

“This poor child would be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we will put her to bed.”

M. d’Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with NoirtierdeVillefort, expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered.

They carried ValentinedeVillefort away; she had revived, but could scarcely move or speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. She had, however, just power to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul. D’Avrigny followed the invalid, wrote a prescription, ordered GerarddeVillefort to take a cabriolet, go in person to a chemist’s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself, and wait for him in his daughter’s room. Then, having renewed his injunction not to give ValentinedeVillefort anything, he went down again to NoirtierdeVillefort, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no one was listening:

“Do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?”

“Yes,” said the old man.

“We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.” NoirtierdeVillefort made a sign that he was ready to answer. “Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?”

“Yes.” D’Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching NoirtierdeVillefort:

“Pardon what I am going to say,” added he, “but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?” NoirtierdeVillefort raised his eyes to heaven.

“Do you know of what he died!” asked d’Avrigny, placing his hand on NoirtierdeVillefort’s shoulder.

“Yes,” replied the old man.

“Do you think he died a natural death?” A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of NoirtierdeVillefort.

“Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?”

“Yes.”

“Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?”

“No.”

“Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked ValentinedeVillefort?”

“Yes.”

“Then will she die too?” asked d’Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze on NoirtierdeVillefort. He watched the effect of this question on the old man.

“No,” replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner.

“Then you hope?” said d’Avrigny, with surprise.

“Yes.”

“What do you hope?” The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer.

“Ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’Avrigny. Then, turning to NoirtierdeVillefort,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”

“No.”

“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on ValentinedeVillefort?”

“Yes.”

“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject. “Then how do you hope ValentinedeVillefort will escape?”

NoirtierdeVillefort kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D’Avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said d’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to you”—NoirtierdeVillefort did not let him finish.

“Yes,” said he.

“To prepare her system to resist poison?”

“Yes.”

“By accustoming her by degrees——”

“Yes, yes, yes,” said NoirtierdeVillefort, delighted to be understood.

“Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give you.”

“Yes.”

“And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison?” NoirtierdeVillefort’s joy continued. “And you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’Avrigny. “Without that precaution ValentinedeVillefort would have died before assistance could have been procured. The dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and this time, at any rate, ValentinedeVillefort will not die.”

A superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment GerarddeVillefort returned.

“Here, doctor,” said he, “is what you sent me for.”

“Was this prepared in your presence?”

“Yes,” replied the procureur.

“Have you not let it go out of your hands?”

“No.”

D’Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.

“Well,” said he, “let us go to ValentinedeVillefort; I will give instructions to everyone, and you, GerarddeVillefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them.”

 

At the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to ValentinedeVillefort’s room, accompanied by GerarddeVillefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of GerarddeVillefort. No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it. About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o’clock. The lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant, who, according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in advance.

This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was called Il Signor Giacomo EdmondDantes. Workmen were immediately called in, and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house. 


We saw in a preceding chapter how HermineDanglars went formally to announce to HeloisedeVillefort the approaching marriage of EugenieDanglars and M. AndreaCavalcanti. This formal announcement, which implied or appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted. We beg them to take one step backward, and to transport themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes, into the showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was the pride of its owner, Danglars.

In this room, at about ten o’clock in the morning, the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and listening to every sound. When his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.

“Étienne,” said he, “see why Mademoiselle EugenieDanglars has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.”

Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm; EugenieDanglars had that morning requested an interview with her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. The singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room. Étienne soon returned from his errand.

“Mademoiselle’s lady’s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.”

Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and the indulgent father. This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper. Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father.

“Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study? and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?”

He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and EugenieDanglars appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera.

“Well, EugenieDanglars, what is it you want with me? and why in this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?”

“I quite understand why you ask, sir,” said EugenieDanglars, making a sign that her father might be seated, “and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation. I will answer them both, and contrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least difficult. I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker’s study. Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the quantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and Peru, have generally a strange influence on a father’s mind, and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents. I have, therefore, chosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother’s, and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals. I rely much on external impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies.”

“Very well,” replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.

“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said EugenieDanglars, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation. Now, let us return to the first. You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two words, sir; I will not marry count AndreaCavalcanti.”

Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven.

 

“Yes, indeed, sir,” continued EugenieDanglars, still quite calm; “you are astonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not manifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.”

“Well?” asked Danglars.

“Well, sir,” replied EugenieDanglars, “I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible.”

“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, EugenieDanglars? what reason do you assign?”

“My reason?” replied the young girl. “Well, it is not that the man is more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, M. AndreaCavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind. It is not, either, that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a schoolgirl’s reason, which I consider quite beneath me. I actually love no one, sir; you know it, do you not? I do not then see why, without real necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion. Has not some sage said, ‘Nothing too much’? and another, ‘I carry all my effects with me’? I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek; one is, I believe, from Phædrus, and the other from Bias. Well, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life—for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes—I cast into the sea my useless encumbrance, that is all, and I remain with my own will, disposed to live perfectly alone, and consequently perfectly free.”

“Unhappy girl, unhappy girl!” murmured Danglars, turning pale, for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered.

“Unhappy girl,” replied EugenieDanglars, “unhappy girl, do you say, sir? No, indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected. Happy, on the contrary, for what am I in want of? The world calls me beautiful. It is something to be well received. I like a favorable reception; it expands the countenance, and those around me do not then appear so ugly. I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all I meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents. I am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in France. I am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the Porte Saint-Martin and Gaîté, who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren. Besides, the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That. And so—being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the comic operas say, and rich—and that is happiness, sir—why do you call me unhappy?”

Danglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence, could not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation. Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently turned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a resolute mind.

“Truly, my daughter,” replied he with a smile, “you are all you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell you which, but would rather leave you to guess it.”

EugenieDanglars looked at Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed.

“My daughter,” continued the banker, “you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.”

EugenieDanglars bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared for a discussion.

“My daughter,” continued Danglars, “when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry. Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of living again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness, I tell you at once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.”

“This is not to the purpose,” said EugenieDanglars; “let us speak candidly, sir; I admire candor.”

“Oh,” said Danglars, “I can, when circumstances render it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice. I will therefore proceed. I have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake, for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment (you admire candor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain commercial speculations I am desirous of entering into.” EugenieDanglars became uneasy.

 

“It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry with me, for you have sought this disclosure. I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you, who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions and sensations. But in that same banker’s study, where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady, that many things may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not marry. There one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous susceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit sustains him as breath animates the body; and M. de EdmondDantes once gave me a lecture on that subject, which I have never forgotten. There we may learn that as credit sinks, the body becomes a corpse, and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter.”

But EugenieDanglars, instead of stooping, drew herself up under the blow. “Ruined?” said she.

“Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean,” said Danglars, almost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man; “ruined—yes, that is it.”

“Ah!” said EugenieDanglars.

“Yes, ruined! Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as the tragic poet says. Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you.”

“Oh,” cried EugenieDanglars, “you are a bad physiognomist, if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me. I ruined? and what will that signify to me? Have I not my talent left? Can I not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you would never have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself; and which, instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality, will be accompanied with acclamations, with bravos, and with flowers? And if I do not possess that talent, which your smiles prove to me you doubt, should I not still have that ardent love of independence, which will be a substitute for wealth, and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self-preservation? No, I grieve not on my own account, I shall always find a resource; my books, my pencils, my piano, all the things which cost but little, and which I shall be able to procure, will remain my own.

“Do you think that I sorrow for HermineDanglars? Undeceive yourself again; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without affecting her. She has taken care for herself,—at least I hope so,—for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me. She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty. Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and understood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to have an undue power over me. From my earliest recollections, I have been beloved by no one—so much the worse; that has naturally led me to love no one—so much the better—now you have my profession of faith.”

“Then,” said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all due to offended paternal love,—“then, mademoiselle, you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin?”

“Your ruin? I accelerate your ruin? What do you mean? I do not understand you.”

“So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen.”

“I am all attention,” said EugenieDanglars, looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze.

“MonsieurCavalcanti,” continued Danglars, “is about to marry you, and will place in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million livres.”

“That is admirable!” said EugenieDanglars with sovereign contempt, smoothing her gloves out one upon the other.

“You think I shall deprive you of those three millions,” said Danglars; “but do not fear it. They are destined to produce at least ten. I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway, the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians, in the fantastic Mississippi scheme. As I look at it, a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the Ohio. We make in our case a deposit, on a mortgage, which is an advance, as you see, since we gain at least ten, fifteen, twenty, or a hundred livres’ worth of iron in exchange for our money. Well, within a week I am to deposit four millions for my share; the four millions, I promise you, will produce ten or twelve.”

“But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you appear to recollect so well,” replied EugenieDanglars, “I saw you arranging a deposit—is not that the term?—of five millions and a half; you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning.”

“Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five millions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have hesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently sustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather shaken. That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had employed it for another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy. I do not despise bankruptcies, believe me, but they must be those which enrich, not those which ruin. Now, if you marry MonsieurCavalcanti, and I get the three millions, or even if it is thought I am going to get them, my credit will be restored, and my fortune, which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality, will revive. Do you understand me?”

“Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?”

“The greater the amount, the more flattering it is to you; it gives you an idea of your value.”

“Thank you. One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune MonsieurCavalcanti will bring without touching the money? This is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. I am willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others.”

“But since I tell you,” cried Danglars, “that with these three million——”

“Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those three million?”

“I hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit.”

“Shall you be able to pay MonsieurCavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry?”

“He shall receive them on returning from the mayor’s20.”

“Very well!”

“What next? what more do you want?”

“I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?”

“Absolutely.”

“Then, as I said before, sir,—very well; I am ready to marry MonsieurCavalcanti.”

“But what are you up to?”

“Ah, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?”

Danglars bit his lips. “Then,” said he, “you are ready to pay the official visits, which are absolutely indispensable?”

“Yes,” replied EugenieDanglars.

“And to sign the contract in three days?”

“Yes.”

“Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!”

Danglars pressed his daughter’s hand in his. But, extraordinary to relate, the father did not say, “Thank you, my child,” nor did the daughter smile at her father.

“Is the conference ended?” asked EugenieDanglars, rising.

Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d’Armilly’s fingers, and EugenieDanglars was singing Brabantio’s malediction on Desdemona. At the end of the piece Étienne entered, and announced to EugenieDanglars that the horses were to the carriage, and that the HermineDanglars was waiting for her to pay her visits. We have seen them at GerarddeVillefort’s; they proceeded then on their course.
